# Akrophonobolos

Python package for handling Ancient Athenian monetary values in
talents, drachmas and obols, including input and output in Greek
acrophonic numerals (such as êÖé, êÖç, êÖå, êÖã, êÖä, etc.)

The denominations of Ancient Athenian money were the _t√°lanton_
(œÑŒ¨ŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøŒΩ, or talent), the _drakhm·∏ó_ (Œ¥œÅŒ±œáŒºŒÆ, or drachma), and the
_obol√≥s_ (·ΩÄŒ≤ŒøŒªœåœÇ, or obol). Six _obolo√≠_ made a _drakhm·∏ó_, and 6,000
_drakhma√≠_ a _t√°lanton_ (which was 57 lbs. of silver).

Large sums of money are found in forms like ‚Äú1 _t√°lanton_ 813
_drakhma√≠_ 1¬Ω _obolo√≠_.‚Äù Math with these figure can be very annoying,
so Akrophonobolos simpfifies this.

## Installation

    pip install akrophonobolos
    
## Usage

Akrophonobols provides a class, `Khremata` (œáœÅŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, "money") and
function for manipulating these.

### Initializing

An instance of `Khremata` can be initialized in several different ways:

With a string that gives amounts with the abbreviations `t`, `d`, and
`b` or `o`:

    >>> import akrophonobolos as obol
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t 813d 1.5b")
    Khremata (1t 813d 1¬Ωb [= 40879.5 obols])

You can use upper or lowercase letters, and spaces do not matter:

    >>> obol.Khremata("1T 813D 1.5B")
    Khremata (1t 813d 1¬Ωb [= 40879.5 obols])

    >>> obol.Khremata("1t813d1.5b")
    Khremata (1t 813d 1¬Ωb [= 40879.5 obols])
    
You can use `o` for obols, but since this is too similar to a zero,
`b` is better:

    >>> obol.Khremata("1t 813d 1.5o")
    Khremata (1t 813d 1¬Ωb [= 40879.5 obols])

    >>> obol.Khremata("1T 813D 1.5O")
    Khremata (1t 813d 1¬Ωb [= 40879.5 obols])
	
Internally, the `Khremata` class stores the value as a (possibly
fractional) number of _obolo√≠_, and this number can be used directly
to initialize an instance:

    >>> obol.Khremata(40879.5)
    Khremata (1t 813d 1¬Ωb [= 40879.5 obols])
	
Finally you can use a string of [Unicode Greek acrophonic
numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_Numbers_(Unicode_block)):

    >>> obol.Khremata("Œ§êÖÖŒóŒóŒóŒîêÖÇêÖÇêÖÇŒôêÖÅ")
    Khremata (1t 813d 1¬Ωb [= 40879.5 obols])
    
### Formatting

There are methods to format the value as an abbreviation, which is the
default string representation:

    >>> m = obol.Khremata("1t 813d 1.5b")
    >>> m.as_abbr()
    '1t 813d 1¬Ωb'
    >>> print(m)
    1t 813d 1¬Ωb
    
It can also be output as a phrase:

    >>> m.as_phrase()
    '1 talent, 813 drachmas, 1¬Ω obols'
    
And as Greek numerals:

    >>> m.as_greek()
    'Œ§êÖÖŒóŒóŒóŒîêÖÇêÖÇêÖÇŒôêÖÅ'
    
### Math

You can do basic math with instances of `Khremata`

    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") + obol.Khremata("3000d")
    Khremata (1t 3000d [= 54000.0 obols])
    
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") - obol.Khremata("3000d")
    Khremata (3000d [= 18000.0 obols])
    
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") * 2
    Khremata (2t [= 72000.0 obols])
    
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") / 2
    Khremata (3000d [= 18000.0 obols])

Comparisons:

    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") == obol.Khremata("1t")
    True
    
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") > obol.Khremata("3000d")
    True
    
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") < obol.Khremata("3000d")
    False
    
Most of these operators work both between two instance of `Khremata`
and between a `Khremata` and anything that can be converted into a
`Khremata`:

    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") + "3000d"
    Khremata (1t 3000d [= 54000.0 obols])
   
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") - "ŒßŒßŒß"
    Khremata (3000d [= 18000.0 obols])
    
    >>> obol.Khremata("1t") == 36000
    True
    
    >>> 18000.0 < obol.Khremata("1t")
    True
    
You cannot multiple two instances of `Khremata` since "talents
squared" does not have any meaning (this raises an
`UndefinedMonetaryOperation` error). If you divide a `Khremata` by a
`Khremata` though the units cancel out and the operation returns a
unitless `Fraction`:

    >>> obol.Khremata("1500d") / obol.Khremata("1t")
    Fraction(1, 4)
    
### Fractions

Above, we said that the `Khremata` class stores the value internally
as a (possibly fractional) number of _obolo√≠_. The more correct way to
state that is that internally, the `Khremata` stores the value
internally, in _obolo√≠_, as a Python
[Fraction](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html). You can
access this directly as the `b` property of the class. In many cases,
of course, this will be a unit fraction:

    >>> m = obol.Khremata("100t")
    >>> m.b
    Fraction(3600000, 1)
    
But monetary sums could be recorded down to the quarter-obol:

    >>> m = obol.Khremata("1t 1d 1.25b")
    >>> m.b
    Fraction(144029, 4) 
    
which is the `Fraction` form of 36,007.25 _obolo√≠_. Storing the value
as a `Fraction` avoid some issues with floating point math and better
approximates how Ancient Greeks did math, since they did not use
decimal numbers.
