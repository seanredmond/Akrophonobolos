Akrophonobolos is a Python package for handling Ancient Athenian
monetary values in talents, drachmas and obols, including input and
output in Greek acrophonic numerals (such as 𐅎, 𐅍, 𐅌, 𐅋, 𐅊, etc.)

The denominations of Ancient Athenian money were the *tálanton*
(τάλαντον, or talent), the *drakhmḗ* (δραχμή, or drachma), and the
*obolós& (ὀβολός, or obol). Six *oboloí* made a *drakhmḗ*, and 6,000
*drakhmaí* a *tálanton* (which was 57 lbs. of silver).

Large sums of money are found in forms like “1 *tálanton* 813
*drakhmaí* 1½ *oboloí*.” Math with these figures can be very annoying,
so Akrophonobolos simpfifies this.
